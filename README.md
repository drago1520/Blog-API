# Blog-API
I created the API for the Blog to add, edit, delete posts. The Front-end was pre-installed. All HTTP requests were used.

How to run:
1. Install mongoDB latest.
2. npm i
3. mongod (to run mongoDB)
4. nodemon index.js
5. nodemon server.js
6. Open localhost:3000 and play around with your blog.
